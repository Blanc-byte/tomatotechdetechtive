    "0": "Bacterial Spot: Characterized by small, water-soaked lesions that eventually darken and become scabby. This disease is caused by various bacterial pathogens, leading to significant damage to the plant tissue.",
    "1": "Early Blight: Symptoms include dark, concentric spots on the lower leaves, often accompanied by premature leaf drop. The disease is caused by the fungal pathogen Alternaria solani, and can significantly reduce plant yield.",
    "2": "Healthy: The plant shows no visible signs of disease, with its foliage appearing green and robust. There are no abnormalities in the plant's growth pattern or leaf structure.",
    "3": "Late Blight: This disease is marked by large, irregular brown patches surrounded by yellow halos. If left untreated, it can lead to plant death. It is caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans.",
    "4": "Leaf Mold: Characterized by yellow spots on the upper leaf surfaces and a fuzzy, gray mold growth on the underside. This fungal disease is caused by Passalora fulva and primarily affects tomato plants under humid conditions.",
    "5": "Mosaic Virus: This viral infection leads to irregular patterns of light and dark green discoloration on the leaves. It is transmitted by insect vectors, such as aphids, and can reduce plant vigor and yield.",
    "6": "Septoria Leaf Spot: Fungal lesions with dark borders and gray centers develop on the leaves, often leading to premature defoliation. Caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici, it is a significant disease in tomato cultivation.",
    "7": "Spider Mites: These are microscopic pests that cause tiny yellow speckles on leaves. Their feeding also results in the formation of fine webbing on the plant. Over time, they can severely damage the plant's photosynthetic ability.",
    "8": "Target Spot: This fungal disease results in circular lesions with concentric rings, often surrounded by yellow halos. It can affect both leaves and stems, causing premature plant stress and potential yield loss.",
    "9": "Yellow Leaf Curl Virus: Characterized by upward curling and yellowing of the leaves, this disease is spread by whiteflies and can stunt plant growth, severely affecting both yield and fruit quality."
